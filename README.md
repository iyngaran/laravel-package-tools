This package contains a `PackageServiceProvider` that you can use in your packages to easily register config files,
migrations, and more.

Here's an example of how it can be used.

```php
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;

class YourPackageServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package
            ->name('your-package-name')
            ->hasConfigFile()
            ->hasViews()
            ->hasTranslations()
            ->hasAssets()
            ->hasRoute('web')
            ->hasMigration('create_package_tables')
            ->hasCommand(YourCoolPackageCommand::class);
    }
}
```

Under the hood it will do the necessary work to register the necessary things and make all sorts of files publishable.

## Getting started

This package is opinionated on how you should structure your package. To get started easily, consider using [our package-skeleton repo](https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravel) to start your package. The skeleton is structured perfectly to work perfectly with the `PackageServiceProvider` in this package.

## Usage

In your package you should let your service provider extend `Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider`.

```php
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;

class YourPackageServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public function configurePackage(Package $package) : void
    {
        $package->name('your-package-name');
    }
}
```

Passing the package name to `name` is mandatory.

### Working with a config file

To register a config file, you should create a php file with your package name in the `config` directory of your package. In this example it should be at `<package root>/config/your-package-name.php`.

If your package name starts with `laravel-`, we expect that your config file does not contain that prefix. So if your package name is `laravel-cool-package`, the config file should be named `cool-package.php`.

To register that config file, call `hasConfigFile()` on `$package` in the `configurePackage` method.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasConfigFile();
```

The `hasConfigFile` method will also make the config file publishable. Users of your package will be able to publish the config file with this command.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=your-package-name-config
```

### Working with views

Any views your package provides, should be placed in the `<package root>/resources/views` directory.

You can register these views with the `hasViews` command.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasViews();
```

This will register your views with Laravel.

If you have a view `<package root>/resources/views/myView.blade.php`, you can use it like this: `view('your-package-name::myView')`. Of course, you can also use subdirectories to organise your views. A view located at `<package root>/resources/views/subdirectory/myOtherView.blade.php` can be used with `view('your-package-name::subdirectory.myOtherView')`.


Calling `hasViews` will also make views publishable. Users of your package will be able to publish the config file with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=your-package-name-views
```

### Working with translations

Any translations your package provides, should be placed in the `<package root>/resources/lang/<language-code>` directory.

You can register these translations with the `hasTranslations` command.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasTranslations();
```

This will register the translations with Laravel.

Assuming you save this translation file at `<package root>/resources/lang/en/translations.php`...

```php
<?php

return [
    'translatable' => 'translation',
];
```

... your package and users will be able to retrieve the translation with:

```php
trans('your-package-name::translations.translatable'); // returns 'translation'
```

If your package name starts with `laravel-` then you should leave that off in the example above.


Calling `hasTranslations` will also make translations publishable. Users of your package will be able to publish the config file with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=your-package-name-translations
```

### Working with assets

Any assets your package provides, should be placed in the `<package root>/resources/dist/` directory.

You can make these assets publishable the `hasAssets` method.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasAssets();
```

Users of your package will be able to publish the config file with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=your-package-name-assets
```

This will copy over the assets to the `public/vendor/<your-package-name>` directory in the app where your package is installed in.

### Working with migrations

The `PackageServiceProvider` assumes that any migrations are placed in this directory: `<package root>/database/migrations`. Inside that directory you can put any migrations. Make sure they all have a `php.stub` extension. Using that extension will make sure that static analysers won't get confused with classes existing in multiple places when your migration gets published.

To register your migration, you should pass its name without the extension to the `hasMigration` table. 

If your migration file is called `create_my_package_tables.php.stub` you can register them like this:

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasMigration('create_my_package_tables');
```

Should your package contain multiple migration files, you can just call `hasMigration` multiple times or use `hasMigrations`.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasMigrations(['my_package_tables', 'some_other_migration']);
```

Calling `hasMigration` will also make migrations publishable. Users of your package will be able to publish the config file with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=your-package-name-migrations
```

Like you might expect, published migration files will be prefixed with the current datetime.

### Registering commands

You can register any command you package provides with the `hasCommand` function.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasCommand(YourCoolPackageCommand::class);
````

If your package provides multiple commands, you can either use `hasCommand` multiple times, or pass an array to `hasCommands`

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasCommands([
        YourCoolPackageCommand::class,
        YourOtherCoolPackageCommand::class,
    ]);
```

### Working with routes

The `PackageServiceProvider` assumes that web and api route files are placed in this directory: `<package root>/routes`.

To register your web route, you should call the `hasWebRoutes` method. This method will load the routes from `web.php` and it will use the `web` middleware.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasWebRoutes();
```

To register your api route, you should call the `hasApiRoutes` method. This method will load the routes from `api.php` and it will use the `api` middleware.

```php
$package
    ->name('your-package-name')
    ->hasApiRoutes();
```

### Using lifecycle hooks

You can put any custom logic your package needs while starting up in one of these methods:

- `registeringPackage`: will be called at the start of the `register` method of `PackageServiceProvider` 
- `packageRegistered`: will be called at the end of the `register` method of `PackageServiceProvider`
- `bootingPackage`: will be called at the start of the `boot` method of `PackageServiceProvider`
- `packageBooted`: will be called at the end of the `boot` method of `PackageServiceProvider`
